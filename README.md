Memorizer is a JavaFX + Spring application designed to make language learning easier through interactive word memorization. It lets users add, edit, and manage custom word lists, then practice them with adaptive quizzes that track progress and confidence.

The client features a minimal and keyboard-friendly interface, while the server handles database operations via REST APIs. Though built for vocabulary learning, it can also be adapted to remember other information like dates or names.

The file "Documentazione.pdf" contains a more detailed documentation of the project (in Italian).
